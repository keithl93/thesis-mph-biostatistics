## Abstract

### Introduction: 
Prescription pain relievers are the second most used illicit drug in the US, after marijuana use and misuse of prescription pain relievers (PPRM) can lead to serious health complications, such as overdose and death. There are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the specific patterns of pain reliever usage among individuals with mental health disorders and understanding this complex relationship is essential for developing targeted interventions and optimizing treatment strategies. 
### Methods: 
US adults in the study were drawn from the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health dataset (n=16,798). Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was conducted looking at PPRM and serious psychological distress, as a marker of mental health illnesses, among US adults, and examine other covariates.
### Results: 
After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education status, employment, depression, and use of mental health services or alcohol/drug treatment services, ever PPRM was associated with 1.50 increased odds of serious psychological distress in the past 30 days (CI: 1.35-1.68). Protective factors included male, increasing age, college education, and increasing income.
### Conclusion: 
It is important to create accessible, tailored, and appropriate mental health services to cater to the needs of individuals experiencing serious psychological distress and potentially prevent or address comorbid PPRM. By addressing both mental health and substance misuse in a coordinated manner, healthcare providers and policymakers can work towards enhancing the well-being and quality of life of individuals dealing with serious psychological distress.
